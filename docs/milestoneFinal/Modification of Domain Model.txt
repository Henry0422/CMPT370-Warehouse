Modification of Domain Model:
1. Removed schedule from Employee and added employee ID, since the system doesn't need schedule anymore.
2. Added quantity attribute in Item Description, because we figured out the quantity of items is important for a warehouse.
3. Added size and weight attribute in Item, because we figured out these attributes are factors for organizing the warehouse.
4. Added name and quantity attribute in Shipments Information, because we figured out they are required information for shipment.
